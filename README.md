### Introduction

Here is my work for the IBM Data Analyst Certification. The purpose was to identify future skill requirements 
for IT industry and answer some questions like :

- What are the top programming languages in demand?
- What are the top database skills in demand?
- What are the popular IDEs?

Programming languages are Python and SQL, and I use IBM Cognos Analytics for Data Viz, which is a very similar tool to Power BI and Tableau (with drag and drop functionalities allowing you to make nice charts easily from .csv or .sql data file). Dashboards are available in Tableau as well.

### Tech Stack : 

#Python #SQL #Scrapping #APIs #Amazon S3  #Tableau #IBM Cognos


The notebook roughly follows this track:

> Data Collection (APIs & scrapping with bs4)
> 
> Data Wrangling
> 
> Some EDA


Dashboards are included in a global presentation on PDF format (DA_survey.pdf)

### Datasets : 

Most of them come with scrapping or APIs or simply downloaded from an S3 repository, links and methods are explained in the notebook. 
However, the GitHub Jobs API we used in this project is deprecated, so I provide the file countries.xls which represents some data I got from this former API.

### Data Viz :

I made some dataviz inside the notebook with Matplotlib and Seaborn, but I used Tableau & IBM Cognos for the dashboards of my PPT presentation. You can go directly to the them either in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/Data_Survey/Someotherinsights_1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) or [IBM Cognos Analytics](https://eu-gb.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/dashboards/245bc86c-0c69-485e-90e7-06286ce9433f/view/7813fc1e1db039c01fc8eee407917a0e2e307054b7bbd557d4847b495d322097f36f14c2c8281a09da145137a2be1a5198)
