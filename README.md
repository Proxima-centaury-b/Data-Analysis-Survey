Here is my work for the IBM Certified Data Analyst Capstone. The purpose was to identify future skill requirements 
for IT industry and answer some questions like :

- What are the top programming languages in demand?
- What are the top database skills in demand?
- What are the popular IDEs?

Programming languages are Python and SQL, and I use IBM Cognos Analytics for Data Viz, which is a very similar tool to Power BI and Tableau (with drag and drop functionalities allowing you to make nice charts easily from .csv or .sql data file)

### Tech Stack : 

#Python #Scrapping #APIs #S3 #SQL #DataViz


The notebook roughly follows this track:

> Data Collection (APIs & scrapping with bs4)
> 
> Data Wrangling
> 
> Some EDA


Dashboards are included in a global presentation on PDF format (DA_survey.pdf)
